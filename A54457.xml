         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The ſubject matter of their prayer: and that is 1. that <hi>God would turn them again,</hi> and 2. <hi>cauſe his face to ſhine;</hi> and then 3. we have here the bleſſed fruit, and happy effect,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43971:23"/>
which they promiſe to themſelves, upon audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that is, <hi>that they ſhall be ſaved. Turn us again, O Lord God of Hoſts: cauſe thy face to ſhine, and we ſhall be ſaved.</hi> This prayer is but ſhort, but exceeding ſweet; the words few, but very full. For we have contained in them, 1. The great Goſpel-bleſſing, and that of <hi>Jeſus</hi> being raiſed up by his Father, which is the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of us away from our iniquities. <hi>Act. 3. 26. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you firſt, God having raiſed up his ſon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ſent him to bleſs you:</hi> but how? <hi>in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away every one of you from his iniquities.</hi> 2. We have contain'd in them man's chief happineſs, and his true and onely felicity, <hi>viz.</hi> God's favour, the light of his countenance, for God to cauſe his face to ſhine. 3. Man's being ſaved; which is very comprehenſive and does denote, not onely freedom from Enemies, and evils of all ſorts, though that moſt properly, but fruition alſo of all good.</p>

Look as that was, and is the very ſpring and foundation of all our woe, ſo this of our weal; and in all our miſeries and calamities, the very firſt ſtep to our cure and recovery begins here: and hence is it, that the Church and people of God are here ſo urgent upon this, again and again; yea and hence is this held forth as the great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deſign of Chriſt, in ſuffering for our ſins, that he might bring us to God; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, we could never have been brought again to be happy. 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 18.

And thus they here beg of God, to turn them again, and to heal their backſlidings; and though this is, and ought to be our endeavour, yet it being God's work, as unable to turn themſelves, they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him: and this turn we ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, and to pray for ſtill, more and more, it being the work and buſineſs of our whole

lives, to turn to God more and more; the laſt ſtep of repentance being the firſt ſtep of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the laſt ſtep of turning the firſt ſtep of triumphing.</p>
               <p>Some indeed do render this, <hi>turn us again,</hi> return us, or reſtore us, recover us, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſay they, from our Captivity to our former ſtate, &amp;c.

So that Repentance, Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Salvation, is that which is here pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, that God would turn their hearts by unfeigned repentance, that ſo they might be fit for deliverance.</p>

               <p>THE time and ſeaſon, when it was that they made this prayer, that God <hi>would turn them again,</hi> &amp;c. it was a time of trouble, and diſtreſs. Whence obſerve,</p>
               <p>Doct. 1. <hi>When miſeries and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities do abide the Church and people of God, that which then more eſpecially and moſt earnestly they are to pray for, it is that the Lord would vouchſafe them ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual mercies:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As that God would <hi>turn them again, and cauſe his face to ſhine,</hi> that he would <hi>lift up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the light of his Countenance,</hi> vouchſafe them his favour, and grace, &amp;c.

                  </note> they are to ſeek at all times, <hi>Pſal. 105. 4. Seek the Lord and his ſtrength, ſeek his face ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> but then more eſpecially, and more than the removal of outward evils, or the obtaining of other mercies and bleſſings; becauſe God then ſeems to ſuſpend them, and as it was to hide his face, and to withdraw the ſenſe of his favour: and then they moſt need them, yea and then the experiencing of ſuch mercies is moſt ſeaſonable. Thus the Church and people of God do here: the Lord <hi>fed them with the bread of tears, and gave them tears to drink in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43971:26"/>
great meaſure,</hi> &amp;c. And what do they now pray and importune for? for ſpiritual bleſſings, Soul-mercies, that God would turn them again, and cauſe his face to ſhine, and thus we are to doe</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 1. Becauſe this is that which the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, and puts his people upon, and adviſes them to: As <hi>Hoſea 14. 1, 27. take with you words, and turn to the Lord. Say unto him, take away all iniquity, and receive us graciouſly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Zeph. 2. 3. Seek ye the Lord, ſeek righteouſneſs, ſeek meekneſs, &amp;c.</hi> And how ſhould we bleſs the Lord, that gives us this counſel, and advice, to ſeek things ſo excellent, and of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and wherein we are ſo infinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, and the having of which is of ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and indiſpenſible neceſſity, as that we cannot at any time want them, nor be without them, much leſs at ſuch times? who would not ſeek God's face, divine favours at any time, but eſpecially at ſuch times?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 2. This is that which others have done, as here, ſo elſewhere: as <hi>Pſal. 90. 14. Moſes</hi> there in a time of great and grievous calamities, prays that the Lord would <hi>return and ſatisfie them early with his mercy,</hi> or loving kindneſs, for ſo the word is rendred elſewhere, as <hi>Pſal.</hi>

Yea in the way of thy judgments, O Lord, have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we waited for thee: the deſire of our ſoul is to thy name, and to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43971:27"/>
of thee.</hi> v. 9. <hi>With my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night, with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Lament. 5. 21. Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> often, ſtill when he was in any diſtreſs, he is ſeeking for ſpiritual mercies, as <hi>Pſalm 31. 16. make thy face to ſhine on thy Servant: 35. 5. ſay to my ſoul I am thy Salvation. Pſalm. 119. 76. Let I pray thee thy merciful kindneſs be for my comfort,</hi> v. 77. <hi>let thy tender mercies come unto me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 3. Want of this the Lord complains of. <hi>Hoſ. 7. 4. They aſſemble themſelves for corn and wine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa. 9. 13. neither ſeek they the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 4. To this the promiſe is made of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and healing too. 2 <hi>Chron. 7. 13. If</hi> (ſays the Lord) <hi>I ſhut up heaven, that there be no rain, or ſend peſtilence, &amp;c.</hi> v. 14. <hi>If my people which are called by my name ſhall humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and pray, and ſeek my face, and turn from their evill wayes, then will I hear from Heaven, and will forgive their ſin, and will heal their land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 5. This is the onely way to have thoſe miſeries and calamities removed in mercy, ſo as to be ſanctified before their removal, to ſeek un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God <hi>to turn us again to himſelf, and to cauſe his face to ſhine:</hi> and unleſs the Lord do this, they cannot be removed in mercy, but we muſt expect heavier, and ſorer, as the Lord threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, <hi>Iſ. 9. 13, 14. Amos 4. 11, 12. Levit. 26. 21. &amp;c.</hi> for he will overcome when he judges,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43971:27"/>
but if he vouchſafe thoſe ſpiritual mercies, though the other ſhould continue, they could do us no hurt, the evil and ſting of them being remov'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 6. If the other ſhould ſtill continue, theſe will comfort and ſupport under them, and the joy and comfort of them more than counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail the other; there being no compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, but the one exceedingly tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the other. As the <hi>ſufferings of this preſent</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>time are not worthy to be compared with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be revealed hereafter,</hi> ſo neither are they to be compared with ſpiritual mercies here; as for God to turn us again to himſelf, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our ſins, to cauſe his face to ſhine, to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe us his favour, and his comforts, and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. What ſufferings or afflictions will not theſe comfort and ſupport under? or what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wants will they not more than counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail? what are the world's frowns to God's ſmiles, the world's troubles to God's peace, the world's ſorrows to God's joyes, the world's afflictions to God's conſolations, the world's preſſures to the pleaſures of God's preſence, or its burdens to the reſt which that affords? what are its Bitters to God's Sweets, its Gall and Wormwood to the Wine of his Love? <hi>Cant. 1. 2. Let him kiſs me with the Kiſſes of his mouth, for thy love is better than wine:</hi> and <hi>v. 4.—we will remember thy love more than wine, yea 'tis better than life,</hi> and in it, even in death it ſelf, there is life. And hence is it, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks what is a Paradox to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43971:28"/>
men of the world, <hi>troubled but not diſtreſſed, as ſorrowful yet always rejoycing, as having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and yet poſſeſſing all things, as dying and yet behold we live,</hi> live in the light of God's countenance, in his ſight, as <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6. 2.—<hi>and we ſhall live in his ſight;</hi> where indeed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Soul truly lives, and there it may live, even in death, and have light ariſe to it, even in darkneſs, and ſee light in the greateſt obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and this light, I mean the light of God's countenance, it giveth Songs even in the night, as it did to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> when <hi>thruſt into the inner priſon, and their feet made faſt in the Stocks,</hi> yet God's gracious preſence did ſo cheer their ſpirits, and put ſuch joy into their hearts, that even at midnight they brake forth in praiſes to God. <hi>Acts 16. 25. And at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night Paul and Silas prayed, and ſang praiſes to God, and the priſoners heard them:</hi> they did not onely pray, but ſing prayſes, and ſung ſo loud, that others heard them, <hi>the priſoners heard them,</hi> they were awaken'd by them. And what did they think of them? ſurely they thought they were not well in their wits, to ſing at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a place, and in ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who having <hi>been beaten,</hi> and <hi>many ſtripes laid upon them,</hi> were caſt into priſon, yea thruſt <hi>into the inner priſon,</hi> and their <hi>feet made faſt in the ſtocks,</hi> and yet now to ſing! O if God cauſe but his face to ſhine, if he lift but up the light of his countenance, it will make a man ſing at any time, in any place, in any condition, it will turn a priſon into a Pallace, and a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43971:28"/>
into a Paradiſe. This made <hi>David</hi> to have his Pſalms, yea <hi>Michtams, i.</hi> his golden Pſalms, or (as the <hi>Dutch</hi> render it) his golden Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els<note place="margin">Aureum orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum, aut inſigne, expu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimo auro factum.</note>; it ſignifies what is made of the beſt and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt gold, ſo called becauſe of their ſingular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs and excellency) in the ſaddeſt places, and in the ſaddeſt outward condition; as when the <hi>Philiſtins took him in Gath,</hi> when he <hi>fled from Saul in the Cave,</hi> when <hi>Saul ſent, and they watcht the houſe to kill him,</hi> &amp;c. See Pſalm 56, 57, 59, the Titles: <hi>Moſes,</hi> Pſalm 90. 14. prays, <hi>O ſatisfie us early with thy mercy, i. e.</hi> with thy loving kindneſs, vouchſafe us thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, <hi>that we may rejoyce and be glad all our dayes.</hi> This is enough to make the people of God rejoice, and be glad all their dayes, be they never ſo dark and gloomy, evil and perillous. <hi>As we have received mercy,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>we faint not, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 1. The Lord tels <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> Exod. 33. 14. <hi>My preſence ſhall go with thee, and I will give thee reſt.</hi> Though <hi>Moſes</hi> was to go through a weariſome wilderneſs, and amidſt a weariſom people, yet the Lord's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſhould give him reſt.

Many when they are in pain, and ſick and weak, they cry out indeed, but for what? for eaſe, and health, and recovery, not that they may be turned from their ſins, and recover God's favour; as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> he calls to have other plagues taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but never begs to have the plague of his own heart taken away, which was the greateſt of all, and far worſe than all the other; but this is the voice onely of nature and argues a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs heart, and that which the Lord, as I ſaid, complains of, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 14.</p>

And the Inhabitants ſhall not ſay I am ſick, the people that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their iniquity.</hi> And hence <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 2. our Saviour there bids the man ſick of the Palſie, <hi>be of good cheer, his ſins being forgiven,</hi> though his ſickneſs was not yet cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and ſo had he cauſe, had it never been cured: <hi>In ſix, yea in ſeven troubles</hi> this keeps <hi>all evil from touching us.

                  <hi>peculiar mercies, are to be prayed for with all earnestneſs, not onely ſimply to be asked, to be ſought, but in ſuch a way, and after ſuch a manner,</hi> viz. <hi>frequently and fervently, often and earneſtly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, with ardency and ut moſt importunity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For thus the Church and people of God ſeek them here, <hi>for God to turn them again, and cauſe his face to ſhine,</hi> theſe were Spiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, choice, ſpecial, and peculiar mercies, Soul-benefits, and they are earneſt and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate for them, they beg them once and again, and again, as if they would not be denied them, and as if they were reſolv'd not to be put off without them.</p>
               <p>But what are we to underſtand by Spiritual bleſſings, by ſpecial peculiar mercies? By theſe we are to underſtand, in a word, ſuch as theſe here ſpecified, and ſuch like: as for God to turn us from our ſins to himſelf, to <hi>take away our iniquities, and receive us graciouſly; for him to be our God, and for us to be his people,</hi> and vouchſafe us his favour, Spirit, grace, his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting grace, and his ſanctifying and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, pardon of ſin, and power againſt ſin, the bleſſings of the Covenant, the ſure mercies of <hi>David,</hi> ſuch as we find recorded in theſe and the like places. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33, 34.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43971:31"/>
—32. 38, 39, 40. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25, 26, 27, &amp;c. <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 19. &amp;c. And ſuch bleſſings, ſuch mercies, are thus to be prayed for, thus to be ſought:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 1. Becauſe God thus commands us to ſeek them; and unleſs we thus ſeek them, we do not ſeek them as he enjoyns. <hi>Pſal. 105. 4. Seek the Lord, and his ſtrength: ſeek his face evermore. Math. 6. 33. But ſeek ye firſt the Kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. firſt, not onely in regard of order of time, but earneſtneſs of endevours: we are commanded to ſeek theſe not onely before other things, but more than other things. As theſe muſt be firſt, ſo chief and moſt in our purſuits. So <hi>Joh: 6. 27. Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for the meat which endureth to everlaſting life, which the ſon of man ſhall give unto you, for him hath God the father ſealed:</hi> not that we are forbidden to labour for things neceſſary to this life, for that we are and ought to do; but the meaning is, that we muſt mainly and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>labour for that meat that endures to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life,</hi> that is, for Chriſt and his benefits, thoſe things appointed by God for refreſhing and ſuſtaining the ſoul to eternity. So that this is to be underſtood comparatively, rather for the meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> preferring the one before the other, as when it's ſaid, <hi>Matth. 9. 13. I will have mercy, and not ſacrifice,</hi> he excludes not ſacrifice, but preferreth mercy. So <hi>Luke 11. 9. And I ſay unto you ask, and it ſhall be given you, ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43971:31"/>
opened unto you.</hi> By theſe expreſſions Chriſt enjoyns earneſtneſs and perſeverance in prayer; for it is not a bare ſimple repetition of the ſame thing, but a gradation, and it is meant of things neceſſary to ſalvation; and the whole ſcope of the place is to ſtir up to earneſtneſs, <hi>Ask,</hi> and<note place="margin">Scopus eſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portere nos conſtanter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare, &amp; cum ardore.</note> do not onely ask, but <hi>ſeek,</hi> yea and not onely <hi>ſeek,</hi> but <hi>knock.</hi> Thus when the Lord preſcribes unto <hi>Aaron,</hi> and his Sons, to bleſs the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was by ſupplicating his face and favour, this they were to implore again and again, as in that form, <hi>Numbers 6. 25. The Lord make his face to ſhine upon thee, and be gracious to thee.</hi> v. 26. <hi>The Lord lift up his Countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 2. Becauſe others have thus ſought them, even with all earneſtneſs; as the Church and people of God here, and ſo others elſewhere. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> tels us, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 58. he intreated the favour of God: but how? with his whole heart: <hi>I intreated thy favour with my whole heart.</hi> So how often in the ſame Pſalm does he beg of God to <hi>quicken him, and to teach him his ſtatutes,</hi> nine or ten times the one, and ſeven or eight times the other. So how importunate is he for pardon, <hi>Pſalm 51. 6.—according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my trnſgreſſions.</hi> v. 2. <hi>Waſh me throughly from mine iniquity, &amp; clenſe me from my ſin.</hi> v. 7. <hi>Purge me with hyſop, and I ſhall be clean, waſh me,</hi> &amp;c. v. 9. <hi>Hide thy face from my ſins, and blot out all mine iniquities,</hi> &amp;c. And how importunate was <hi>Jacob</hi> for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing?

                  <hi>Gen. 32. 24. And Jacob was left alone:</hi> this was on purpoſe, and upon choice, to wreſtle with God by ſecret prayer, <hi>and there</hi>

If thy preſence go not with me, carry us not up hence; for wherein ſhall it be known here, that I and thy people have found grace in thy ſight? is it not that thou goeſt with us, &amp;c.</hi> Thus our Saviour tels us, <hi>Math. 11. 12.

                  </note> they made a prey or prize of them, nothing leſs would ſatisfie them; as it is ſaid of <hi>Luther,</hi> that he proteſted he would not be put off with other things <note n="c" place="margin">Proteſtatus ſummè nolle ſic ſatiari ab eo.</note>: and it is ſaid of Father <hi>Latimer,</hi> that he ſo plied the Throne of Grace with this once again,

once again, reſtore the Goſpel to <hi>England,</hi> as if he would have no nay at God's hands, and he many times continued kneeling and knocking ſo long together, that he was not able to riſe up without help: and <hi>Monica,</hi> the mother of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> was ſo earneſt for his converſion, that it was ſaid it was impoſſible for a ſon of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prayers and tears to periſh.

This is the generation of them that ſeek him, that ſeek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.</hi> or ſeek the face of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that is, of the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſo ſome ſupply; others ſay, God is pleaſed to ſtile himſelf by the name of <hi>Jacob,</hi> being the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and there being ſuch a near union between him and his people, as the Church is called Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. or this is <hi>Jacob,</hi> theſe are the true children of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed, that herein imitate and reſemble <hi>Jacob,</hi> who ſo earneſtly ſought the Bleſſing. So that the Saints formerly were ſo earneſt in ſeeking the Lord, and his face, that from thence they were ſtiled a generation of Seekers, ſuch, who having found God, ſeek him yet again, and ſeek him more and more, and here there is ſtill more of God to be found, and therefore more to be ſought, till in heaven we come fully to enjoy him. And theſe are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43971:33"/>
the true Seekers indeed, far and altogether dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from ſome, who have ſo ſtiled themſelves in theſe later days, they being no better indeed, as one ſays, than the Jeſuites by-blows, though they are not yet ſo wiſe as to know their own Father, and an evill and an adulterous genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But theſe true members of the Church indeed, they were ſuch as ſtill ſought the Lord, and his face, with their whole hearts, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt earneſtneſs of deſire. Here are two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct words in the Original, and both denote<note place="margin">

                  </note> more than ordinary ſeeking; the firſt ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a very diligent ſearch, a laborious enquiry, a ſtrong deſire to find what we ſeek, and a kind of unquietneſs or reſtleſneſs, till we find it: As <hi>Pſalm</hi> 132. 4. And the other word ſignifies alſo, to ſeek ſtudiouſly, &amp;c. So that they ſought, and they ſought earneſtly, and there was nothing that they ſought nor deſired more than God and his favour, than communion with him, and conformity to him. And ſhould not we ſeek them now, as others have done formerly? are they not as precious, and have we not as much need of them now as ever? nay by how much there are now clearer diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of them, by ſo much the more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould we ſeek them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 3. Becauſe the nature of them requires it, and may command it; they being things which are ſo precious, and of ſo great importance, and ſo abſolutely and indiſpenſably neceſſary, that what ſhould be ſought with earneſtneſs, if not theſe? as God, and his face and favour,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43971:34"/>
and grace, and pardon. It is reported of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> that <hi>Alexander</hi> being diſpleaſed with them, they not onely laid by their Arms, and put on mourning apparrel, and came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in Troups to his Tent, but that there they remained almoſt for three days together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching his pardon, which at laſt they obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. How much more ſhould we implore God's pardon? But to inſtance onely in theſe two in my Text, as 1. for God to turn us again to himſelf; what an excellent thing is this, to be turned from <hi>darkneſs to light, from Satan to God,</hi> from ſin to grace and holineſs, from evill to good, from miſery to felicity, from hell to heaven? Who would not be thus turned? And then of ſuch abſolute and indiſpenſable neceſſity is it, that we be turn'd, that we dye elſe, we are undone, and periſh elſe, either we muſt be converted or deſtroyed; and then for God to cauſe his face to ſhine, how precious, how excellent is his favour? <hi>Pſalm 36. 7. How excellent is thy loving kindneſs, O God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therein is life, yea it is better than life. Pſalm</hi> 30. 5.—63. 3. and ſo neceſſary, that though many live, no ſoul truly lives, but in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 20. God ſaid there, <hi>he would hide his face from that people, he would ſee what their end ſhould be.</hi> But O how ſad muſt their end be, that he hides his face from, that he takes no pleaſure in? <hi>Pſalm 30. 7. Thou didſt hide thy face, and I was troubled. Job 34. 29. When he giveth quietneſs, who then can make trouble, and when he hideth his face,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43971:34"/>
who then can behold him, whether it be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a nation, or againſt a man onely?</hi> And things of ſuch excellency, and ſuch neceſſity, do not they require, and may they not command importunity? I remember a ſtory, that one relates of a poor woman in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> that being condemned to dye, ſhe fell a crying and ſcrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, as if ſhe meant to pierce the heavens; and the Judg, and thoſe on the Bench bidding her hold her peace, ſhe cryes, O my Lord it is for my life, I beg, I beſeech you, it is for my life: So when thou goeſt to God to beg for ſuch mercies, it is for thy life, yea for what is better than thy life, it is for the life of thy life, the life of thy ſoul, for that without which thou loſeſt thy ſoul, and dyeſt eternally, peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheſt everlaſtingly, and wilt not be earneſt for this? and as blind <hi>Bartimeus,</hi> cry out, and the<note place="margin">Mark 10. 46, 47, 48, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> more others bid thee hold thy peace, cry the more a great deal. <hi>Prov. 2. 3. Yea if thou crieſt after wiſdom, and lifteſt up thy voice for underſtanding, &amp;c.</hi> And what ſhould we cry after, or lift up our voice for, if not for ſuch mercies?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 4. Becauſe this ſhews that we are earneſt for them, and that our deſires are real, and not indifferent, when we are importunate for them, and are reſolved not to go away without them, as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> was for mercy. <hi>Pſalm 57. 1. Be merciful to me O God, be merciful to me, &amp;c.</hi> So for pardon, <hi>Pſalm 51. Waſh me, cleanſe me, purge me, and again waſh me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Geneſ, 30. 1.</note> So <hi>Rachel</hi> for children, <hi>Give me children, or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43971:35"/>
elſe I dye.</hi> So that woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> for her<note place="margin">Math. 15. 21, 22, 23, &amp;c.</note> daughter, ſhe would not be ſaid nay; and <hi>Paul,</hi> that the thorn in the fleſh might depart, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 8. for this thing I beſought the Lord thrice.</hi> And when we are thus earneſt and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, we manifeſt and make appear our deſires are real, and that we pray in truth, and ſuch the Lord is nigh unto. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 145. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 5. Becauſe this ſhews us to be in a fit poſture and capacity to receive them. For this declares, 1. that we need them, that we want them, I mean that we have a due ſenſe of our want of them, when we are importunate for them, and will not be ſaid without them. For take a beggar that comes to your door for an Almes, if he be ſoon ſaid, and preſently goes his way, what do you ſay? ſurely he had no great need, for if he had, he would not ſo ſoon have taken an anſwer. 2. This declares that we value them, and ſet an high price, and eſteem on them, when we are importunate for them; and theſe two bring us into a fit poſture and capacity for to receive them, but elſe we ſhew no great need that we ſee of them, and withall a kind of ſlighting of them. As if a man was to ask ſome great matter, and he ſhould ask it frigidly, coldly, careleſly, what would he ſay, that he askt it of? what is it no more worth than ſo? O when you go to ſeek ſpiritual mercies, you go to ſeek what is of great worth, of more worth than a whole world, and if ever you have them, God will have them va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, and have you ſee your want of them,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43971:35"/>
and ſo be brought into a capacity for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 6. Becauſe we are ſo unworthy of them, of ſo great things, and therefore we muſt the more earneſtly and importunately ask them, and ſeek them, by how much the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy we are of them. <hi>Pſal. 34. 6. This poor man cried unto the Lord.</hi> Truly we are all of us ſuch poor and unworthy creatures, that we had need not onely pray, but cry. Thus that poor woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> being in her own ſenſe<note place="margin">Math. 15. 21, 22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and apprehenſion ſo unworthy, but a <hi>meer dog</hi> as it were, how earneſt is ſhe? why, as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, ſo may we ſay more truly, <hi>we are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the leaſt of all God's mercies,</hi> or <hi>we are</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Geneſ. 32. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>leſs than the leaſt of all God's mercies.</hi> We par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take indeed of many mercies, as we have whole bundles of them, but if we ſearch into them, we can find none ſo little, ſo ſmall, but we are leſs our ſelves; and if we are not worthy of the leaſt, how much more unworthy of ſo great? and therefore when we that are ſo unworthy of any the leaſt mercies, go to God for ſo great, is there not cauſe we ſhould be earneſt and importunate? and ſo the ſight and ſenſe of our ſo great unworthineſs, ſhould ſo much the more ſtir up and increaſe our earneſtneſs, as it hath done in others. So great matters, begg'd of ſo great a Majeſty, and by ſuch as are ſo mean, and unworthy, had need be begg'd with all importunity and earneſtneſs. Majeſty and greatneſs, conſidered with our weakneſs, and unworthineſs, ſhould much excite earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, though ſo worthy,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43971:36"/>

                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. This ſhews the abſolute &amp; indiſpenſable neceſſity of being turn'd again, if ever we be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if ever we enter into heaven, and enjoy God for ever. Why? becauſe by nature we are all turn'd aſide, and turn'd away from theſe, and have our backs upon them, and how can we, unleſs we be turn'd again, ever come to partake of them? Can a man, unleſs he turn, ever come to a place that he hath his back upon, and is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away from? as can he come to a place in the Eaſt, that has his back upon it, and is going a quite contrary way to a place in the Weſt?

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43971:49"/>
heaven, &amp; is going as faſt as he can in the ways that lead to hell, in a quite oppoſite and contrary way and courſe? it cannot be. And therefore this ſhews the abſolute and indiſpenſable neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of being turn'd again, of being converted, if ever we go to heaven, if ever we be ſaved, and come to enjoy God for ever: and hence, ſays our Saviour, <hi>Matth. 18. 3. Except you be converted and become as little children,</hi> (for it is a change not of place, but of diſpoſition, that is required here) <hi>ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> and indeed ye cannot, for till ye are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, your backs are upon it, and ye are going on in a quite oppoſite way to it. Can any go to heaven with their backs upon heaven? No: <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye repent,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh;</hi> and—<hi>turn ye, turn ye,</hi> ſays the Lord,<note place="margin">Luke 13. 3, 5. Ezek. 33. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>from your evill ways, for why will ye dye, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> As if the Lord ſhould have ſaid, How can ye live, unleſs ye turn, that have your backs upon life, and are going on in the ways that lead unto death? And therefore this being our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by nature, that we are all turn'd aſide and turn'd away from God, and our ſin and miſery being ſo great by reaſon thereof, O let us never reſt, 'till we come to be turn'd again; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing that we are more concern'd in than this: and though we cannot turn our ſelves, yet let's ſet upon it, and earneſtly beg of God to do it, as theſe here do, <hi>Turn us again,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Doctr. 2. <hi>Such as are already turn'd to God, and brought home to him, are yet very prone to turn again aſide from him.</hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Let us make that uſe hereof, that the Apoſtle puts us upon, <hi>Gal. 6. 1. Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43971:51"/>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. Being ſo prone and ready to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain aſide from God, let us ſo much the more labour and endeavour to keep with him; and to help us herein, let me propound theſe five or ſix things. As 1. let us preſs upon our hearts theſe following conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The neer and dear relation that we ſtand in to God, I mean of us as are true believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; and let that prevail with us the more to keep with him, and not to turn away from him: why? becauſe he is our God, and Father, and husband, and friend &amp;c. we are as it were eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed and married to him. And ſhould a people go from their God, children from their father,<note place="margin">Iſ. 54. 5. Jer. 31. 32. Prov. 27. 10.</note> the wife from her husband, a man forſake his friend? <hi>Thine own friend, and thy fathers friend forſake not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is no juſt cauſe nor ground, why we ſhould go from him. 1. There being no iniquity in him, nor ever any injury done unto us by him.—<hi>What iniquity have your fathers</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 2. 5. Micah 6. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>found in me. O my people what have I done unto thee? wherein have I wearied thee?</hi> &amp;c. 2. There being no want of any good in him, ſo that there is no need to go from him, he being all-ſufficient: hence the Lord reaſons the caſe with <hi>David,</hi> when he had revolted, and tels him, I did ſo and ſo for thee, and I gave ſuch and ſuch things to thee, <hi>and if that had been too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 7.</note> ſays the Lord, <hi>I would moreover have given
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43971:52"/>
thee ſuch and ſuch things,</hi> and wherefore then haſt thou deſpiſed the commandement of the Lord, &amp;c. what cauſe or ground was there for it? what haſt thou to ſay, or what canſt thou alledge? So we find that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> diſobeying the voice of the Lord, the Angel of the Lord, that is, the Son of God, he pleads with them; I have done ſo and ſo for you, why then<note place="margin">Judges 2. 4.</note> have ye done this? and there being no true cauſe nor ground for it, they anſwer with tears, for it is ſaid, <hi>that they lift up their voice and wept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Can we mend or better our ſelves? and who would change but for the better? But to be ſure, if we go from God, it will be for the worſe. When many that profeſt themſelves the diſciples of Chriſt, went back, and Chriſt ſaid to<note place="margin">John 6. 68.</note> the twelve, <hi>Will ye alſo go away?</hi> you know what <hi>Simon Peter</hi> anſwered the Lord, <hi>To whom ſhould we go, thou haſt the words of eternal life?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Lord, where can we mend our ſelves, to whom ſhall we go to be better? This was the Argument that <hi>Samuel</hi> made uſe of, to keep the people from turning aſide, to follow the Lord. <hi>And turn ye not aſide, for then ſhould you go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>vain things which cannot profit, nor deliver, for they are vain.</hi> It is as if a man for warmth ſhould go from the Sun to the ſhade, or for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the fountain to the broken ciſtern, or from the ſpring to the puddle; or as if a man for freſh air ſhould leave the open field, and ſweet refreſhing gales in a garden, to go to a ſmoaky cottage: <hi>But my people have changed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43971:52"/>
their glory for that which doth not profit, and they</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 2. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>are gone far from me, and walked after vanity. Will a man leave the pleaſant cooling ſnow of</hi>

                  <hi>mount Lebanon, for a dry bare rock of of the field, or ſhall the cool flowing waters be forſaken?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Let's conſider what reſpect God has for ſuch as abide with him, and turn not aſide from him. <hi>Noah</hi> was upright <hi>in his generation,</hi> and<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>walked with God,</hi> when <hi>all fleſh had corrupted their way,</hi> and it is ſaid, <hi>Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.</hi> So, <hi>my ſervant Caleb; becauſe</hi>

                  <hi>he had another ſpirit with him, and hath follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me fully, him will I bring into the Land, &amp;c. And ye are they</hi> (ſays <hi>Chriſt) which have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 22. 28, 29.</note>

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. What a comfort will this be in the evil day, and at the hour of death, if we have not turned back from God, as it has been to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God formerly? <hi>Pſ. 44. 17, 18, 19. Job</hi> 23. 11, 12. and <hi>Iſ.</hi> 38. 3. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Lord doth not <hi>turn away our prayers, nor himſelf, nor his mercy from us,</hi> and why<note place="margin">Pſal. 66. 20. Jer. 32. 40.</note> ſhould we turn away from him? yea he hath made <hi>an everlaſting covenant with us, that he will not turn away from us to do us good, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. If ever he do turn away from us for a time, it is not till we firſt turn away from him. He is firſt in coming, but laſt in going, <hi>he is ever with us, while we are with him,</hi> as the Prophet told <hi>Aſa, 2 Chron.</hi> 15. 2. but if we forſake him, and turn away from him, he will turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from us, yea againſt us, as the Church

complains, <hi>Lam. 3. 3. Surely againſt me is he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he turneth his hand againſt me all the day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us be 1. vigilant; and very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: elſe if we be careleſs, negligent, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, we ſhall be in great danger to miſcarry,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>wherefore let him that thinketh he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> None are likelier to fall than ſuch as are moſt ſelf confident, and ſecure, and therefore let us carry a holy jealouſie continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally over our ſelves: how many caveats have we in Scripture to this purpoſe? <hi>Matth. 26. 41. Luke 21. 36. Heb.</hi> 3. 12. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us be much in prayer, that the Lord would keep us; for if he leave us, we ſhall ſoon<note place="margin">Jude 24.</note> leave him. <hi>Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling,</hi> &amp;c. he alone is able, and therefore we muſt watch and pray both, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us remember and urge the Lord with his promiſe, <hi>viz. that he will put his fear in our</hi>

                  <hi>hearts, that we ſhall not depart from him, and that we ſhall not turn away from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Let us exhort one another daily, &amp;c. This the Apoſtle preſcribes as a good help, to keep us from departing from God. <hi>Take heed bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>

O ſhould not a people return to their God, the ſpouſe to her husband, children to their father? The Prodigal, as ſoon as ever <hi>he came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>

more and more to ſhine on a people or perſon that he turns again to himſelf. For 1. it is his promiſe ſo to do, to be gracious and to manifeſt his favour to ſuch. <hi>Job 33. 23. If there be a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger with him, an interpreter one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to ſhew unto man his uprightneſs,</hi> the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, his rectitude, that is, what is right and ſtraight, <hi>viz.</hi> to repent and turn to God: <hi>Dutch</hi> read it, <hi>to declare unto man his right duty,</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed converſion and true turning to God it is our duty, and it is a right, juſt, and equal duty, and it brings us into a right ſtate, into a right frame, ſets us at rights, and till then our ſtate is wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, crooked, and wrong, nothing is at rights; for how ſhould things be right with us, whiles our hearts and ways are not right with God? but when that which is ſo right is ſhewn to man, and ſhewn powerfully and effectually, ſo as to embrace and do what is made known and ſhewn. Then it follows, <hi>v. 26. He ſhall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him, and he ſhall ſee his face with joy,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord is very gracious, and of a very kind nature and diſpoſition, he has always in himſelf a rich ſtorehouſe of kindneſs and mercy, and then he gives it forth, <hi>Come and let us return unto the Lord, Hoſea</hi> 6. 1. and then <hi>v. 2. we ſhall live in his fight,</hi> or in or before his face, live and enjoy his love and favour, the life of our lives. <hi>He looketh upon men, and if any ſay I have ſinned, and perverted that which was</hi>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43971:58"/>
Thus the Lord waits to be gracious, he waits for our repentings and turnings to him, that he may be gracious, and while we retard our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentings and turnings to him, we retard his grace and favour from our ſelves. There is indeed a previous preventing grace and favour of God, a firſt ſhining of God's face, and breaking forth of<note place="margin">Gratiam qui invenit apud Deum, ab eâ primum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventus eſt, quia eam nemo quaerit; quem ea prius non quaeſierit, &amp; admiſerit. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet.</hi> Conditio ad gratiam reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piendam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſita, nonpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur in nobis, niſi per gratia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praevenientem. <hi>Pareus.</hi>

How graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous was the Lord to <hi>Peter?</hi> upon his repenting and turning again, he was gracious to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Luke 22. 61. And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter,</hi> &amp;c. and how gracious after? <hi>Mark 16. 7.—tell his diſciples and Peter,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo to <hi>Ephraim,</hi> upon repenting and turning, how abundantly did God manifeſt his grace and favour, how lovingly, and meltingly, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly does he ſpeak of him? <hi>Jer. 31. 18, 19, 20. Is Ephraim my dear ſon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>My bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy on him.</hi> And ſo the Prodigal upon his returning, how does the father <hi>meet him, and falls on his neck<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and kiſſes him!</hi>

                  <hi>that he will bleſs them therewith.</hi> It is one thing to have peace, and ſalvation, and deliverance, and mercies, and another thing to be bleſt with them, and to have them in mercy, and as mercies; and this latter is the greater, many have theſe, but few are bleſt with theſe: but when God ſo ſaves a people as to turn them again, and cauſe his face to ſhine, then they are ſav'd in mercy, ſo as to be bleſt with their being ſaved, (I ſpeak now of temporal ſalvation,) then <hi>in love to their ſouls God delivers them,</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſ. 38. 17.</note> And they are not ſo ſaved, as afterward to be deſtroyed, as it is ſaid of the people that the<note place="margin">Jude 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord ſav'd out of the land of Egypt, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he deſtroyed them that believed not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This is the way to be ſav'd univerſally, and that in a threeſold reſpect: 1. which way ſoever we take or underſtand being ſaved. For this word <hi>ſaved</hi> is very comprehenſive, and of large extent, denoting not onely the privative part of happineſs, (though that moſt properly, as freedom from enemies, and evils of all ſorts) but the poſitive alſo, as the fruition of all good: and hence is it here variouſly read, and rendred; we read it, <hi>we ſhall be ſaved,</hi> others, <hi>bleſſed,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43971:61"/>
happy,</hi> or it ſhall be well with us, and all things<note place="margin">Servabimur, ſalvi erimus, beati, verè fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices, omnia nobis feliciter cedent, vive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp; regna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimus, nec ullo bono deſtitue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emur.</note> ſhall happily ſucceed to us, or we ſhall be ſafe and ſecure, and in a good caſe and condition; we ſhall live, and raign, and want no good thing. And now which way ſoever we take or underſtand it, or which way ſoever we read or render it, this here reaches and takes in all, and all follow upon this; God's turning us again, and cauſing his face to ſhine, and when he is pleas'd to do this, to vouchſafe theſe, we may write under it what ever we will, that tends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to our weal, and makes for our good. 2. This is the way to have all ſaved, Kingdom ſaved, Nation ſaved, Church ſaved, Court ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, City ſaved, Countrey ſaved, Towns, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, perſons, our ſelves, ours, others, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, our little ones; to have bodies ſaved, ſouls, religion, lives, liberties, eſtates, goſpel, or whatever elſe is neer or dear to us. 3. This is the way to be ſaved, with all manner and kinds of ſalvation, and from all ſorts and kinds of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, whether temporal, ſpiritual, or eternal. As 1. from our ſins, from their guilt, to have them pardoned and forgiven. <hi>If my people,</hi> ſays the Lord, <hi>ſhall humble themſelves, and pray, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 7. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I pardon their ſins,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>repent ye,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 3. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out,</hi> &amp;c. 2. From our ſufferings, miſeries, and calamities, the miſchievous fruits and effects of ſin. Thus the Lord promiſes, upon his peoples turning to him, not onely to <hi>pardon their ſins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 7. 14.</note> but alſo to <hi>heal their land,</hi> that is, remove thoſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43971:62"/>
judgments, which were as the ſores and wounds of it. So <hi>Hoſ. 6. 1. Come,</hi> ſay they, <hi>and let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto the Lord,</hi> and what then? why then, <hi>he that hath torn, will heal us; and he that hath ſmitten us, will bind us up:</hi> and <hi>v. 2. After two dayes will he revive us,</hi> &amp;c. 3. As from theſe here, ſo from hell, and wrath, and eternal death hereafter. And hence repentance is ſaid to be<note place="margin">Acts 11. 18. 2 Cor. 7. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>repentance unto life,</hi> and <hi>repentance unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>repent and turn your ſelves</hi> (ſays God) <hi>from your tranſgreſſions, ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruine.</hi> Thus God's turning us again, and cauſing his face to ſhine, it remedies all peoples evils and miſeries here, and brings to them full ſalvation hereafter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This is the onely way for a people to be ſaved indeed, to be ſav'd to purpoſe, and in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as you have heard, ſo as in being ſaved to be bleſſed, and happy, and to have it well with them. Thus, this it is the onely way for a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be ſaved, and no other way will do, or will or can prove ſoveraign, or effectual, either for a people or a perſon, either for our ſelves or the nation; no, whatever other ways we take, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempts or experiments we make, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, they will all prove but abortive, and to no purpoſe, nor avail any thing, but we ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh notwithſtanding. And this I propoſe as the onely way, in oppoſition to all worldly carnal ways, and means, and ſhifts, and devices, that men make uſe of, and betake themſelves to, to ſave and ſecure themſelves by, with neglect of this; but in vain and to no purpoſe do they do it: and yet this is that to which men are very
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43971:62"/>
prone, to run to other means and helps, with neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this; as the Scripture declares, and the Lord complains: <hi>when Ephraim ſaw his ſickneſs and Judah his wound, then went Ephraim to the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſea 5. 13. &amp; 7. 11, 12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Aſſyrian, and ſent to King Jareb, yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound. Ephraim alſo is like a ſilly Dove without heart,</hi> that is, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, fooliſh, without judgment and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; why? it follows, <hi>they call to Egypt, they go to Aſſyria,</hi> to aid and relieve them, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the onely way of their help, which was to return to the Lord their God, and ſeek him. This ſpake them fooliſh and ſilly indeed, for what ſays God? <hi>When they ſhall go, I will ſpread my net upon them, I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven,</hi> that is, I will blaſt their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and deſigns, and make the iſſue of them to be their own ruine and confuſion. They thought to mount and ſoar on high, but I will make them come down with a witneſs; and hence ſays God, <hi>Wo unto them, for they have fled from me; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction unto them, for they have tranſgreſſed againſt me,</hi> that is, gone on to rebell againſt me ſtill, in ſtead of turning unto me. And what could betide ſuch, but ruine and deſtruction? So in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 22. how ſedulous and exact are the Jews there in their carnal policies, and worldly contrivances, to ſecure themſelves? but with a neglect of God, and the true way of their ſafety, which was their return to him: <hi>And he diſcovered the covering of Judah.</hi> Some<note place="margin">Iſ. 22. 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> by this Covering underſtand the city it ſelf, whither the people repair'd for ſhelter; others,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43971:63"/>
the Temple, or Sanctuary, and the vain confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they put therein; others, their ſtrong holds, armories, or ſtorehouſes, where their armes and ammunition were beſtowed, or what ever elſe it was, wherein their power, preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or proviſions, for the ſafeguarding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their city did conſiſt, as it follows, <hi>and thou didſt look in that day to the Armour of the houſe of the Forreſt,</hi> that is, as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the Magazine of the Kingdom; <hi>ye have ſeen alſo the breaches of the city of David, that they are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool. And ye have num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the houſes of Jeruſalem, and the houſes have ye broken down to fortify the wall. Ye made alſo a ditch between the two walls, for the water of the old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had reſpect to him that faſhioned it long ago.</hi> Thus as to worldly carnal means and helps, they are very ſedulous and exact, very preciſe in every punctilio, they neither ſpare for pains nor coſt; but they neglecting the main, which was to repent, and turn to God, and which God then in a more ſpecial manner did call for, <hi>v.</hi> 12. all the other availed them nothing, neither did they or could they ſave or ſecure them. And hence the Lord expoſtulates the caſe with them, as concerning their folly and vanity therein: <hi>Jer. 2. 36. Why gaddeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou about ſo much to change thy way?</hi> running for help ſometimes to one party one way, and ſometimes another way: or <hi>to change thy way,</hi> that is, the way I have preſcribed thee, and ſhould be thy
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43971:63"/>
way; as if the Lord had ſaid, thou knoweſt well enough the way of thy weal, thy way to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and why then doeſt thou gad up and down to find out new ways, and to try other ways? why, they ſhall avail thee nothing, <hi>thou alſo ſhalt be aſhamed of Egypt, as thou waſt aſham'd of Aſſyria:</hi> as if the Lord had ſaid, they ſhall all ſerve thee alike, as thou haſt been deceiv'd and been befool'd by the one, ſo ſhalt thou alſo be by the other; yea <hi>v. 37. Thou ſhalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head, (i. e.</hi> with ſorrow, ſhame, and diſgrace, whereof this was a ſign, as it is ſaid of <hi>Tamar,</hi> when raviſhed<note place="margin">2 Sam. 13. 19.</note> by her Brother <hi>Amnon,</hi> that <hi>ſhe laid her hand on her head, and went on crying,) for the Lord hath rejected thy confidences,</hi> that is all thy vain refuges and ways, which thou ſeekeſt and beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thy ſelf to, out of God's way, <hi>the Lord hath rejected them,</hi> or as ſome, deſpiſed them, ſcorn'd them, and as it were derided them, and thy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in imagining to ſave and ſecure thy ſelf by them. <hi>And thou ſhalt not proſper in them,</hi> for<note place="margin">Ezek. 24. 12.</note> they are but lies, as the Lord tels <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> elſewhere, <hi>ſhe hath wearied her ſelf with lies,</hi> that is, with other ways and means then of my appointing; inſtead of repenting and turning to me, the onely true way of her weal, and means of her cure, and which I have ſo often call'd for, and invited her to, with much patience and forbearance, by my Prophets, ſhe hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken her ſelf to other ways and means, run to carnal helps, and all manner of worldly ſhifts and devices; and here ſhe hath been very indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43971:64"/>
taken a great deal of pains, ſo as even to weary her ſelf, running up and down, one while this way, and another while another way, and all to underprop her ruinous condition, and to keep off the threatned deſtruction, but in vain, for they are all but lies and vanities, and ſo ſhe ſhall experience them. And why? it follows, <hi>becauſe her ſcum went not out of her,</hi> that is, her ſin and wickedneſs, ſo call'd for its vileneſs and filthineſs, ſhe ſtill retain'd that, and therefore <hi>ſhe and her ſcum ſhall be in the fire,</hi> that is, ſhe neglecting the onely true way of her weal, and means of her deliverance, which was true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and converſion, all her other worldly and carnal ways and meanes, which ſhe had with ſo much care and toil ſought out, ſhall all prove falſe and unfaithful to her, and deceive her. And hence does the Lord ſo earneſtly and pathetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as being very deſirous and ſollicitous of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalems</hi> weal, invite her to the right way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to avert that heavy deſtruction threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt her, and coming upon her. <hi>O Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>

                  <hi>thou may'ſt be ſaved,</hi> that is, repent and turn from thy wickedneſs, reform thy heart and life. There is indeed the waſhing of juſtification from the guilt of ſin, by the bloud of Chriſt; and of ſanctification from the filth of ſin, by the Spirit of Chriſt: but by this waſhing here, we are to underſtand that of true, ſerious and ſound repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and converſion, and reformation of heart and life from wickedneſs, when the heart is turn'd from it, and engag'd againſt it.

this waſhing we read elſewhere, and it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,<note place="margin">Iſaiah 1. 16. James 4. 8.</note>

And this the Lord here invites <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to, as her onely way of being ſaved: <hi>O Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayeſt be ſaved.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, thou cryeſt indeed, <hi>wo unto us, for we are ſpoiled, v.</hi> 13. but yet there is a way of thy being ſaved, and it is the onely way, and therefore if yet at laſt thou haſt any mind to be ſaved, and to have it well with thee, as I have, and to prevent that utter ruine that is coming upon thee, betake thy ſelf to it, <hi>waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, how long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodg within thee?</hi> Thus the Lord calls all their thoughts and hopes of ſafety elſewhere, and from other means, as forraign forces, and the like, vain; ſuch, as however they fed themſelves with them, ſhould never effect their weal, nor be able to relieve them, but in relying on them, they relyed but upon vanity and falſhood. And hence it is, that the Church and people of God here are ſo intent upon this, and ſo earneſt for this, they importune it no leſs than three times, as if they would have no denial, becauſe they knew full well as this was the right way, and a ſure way, for their weal; ſo it was the onely way, and there was no other, and God muſt do this,

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43971:65"/>
Changes. As 1. in ſubſtance, which is called generation. 2. In place, called local mutation. 3.

Nor 2. in place; for the ſinner is, or may be ſtill in the ſame place where he was before, or if he do change his place, it does not avail any thing here; for ſin (as one well obſerves) like a man's ſickneſs, is carried with him where ever he goes, and change of place, no more than change of beds, does free him, or make him whole. No, it is not change of place, but an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual work of grace that turns the heart. <hi>Cain</hi> was the ſame in the land of <hi>Nod,</hi> as he was where he dwelt before; and the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> which came evil out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> remained the ſame in the wilderneſs.

                  <hi>wilderneſs, yea from the day that they did depart out of the land of Ehypt, untill they came to that place they had been rebellious againſt the Lord. Alſo in Horeb ye provoked the Lord to wrath:

and at Taberah, and at Maſſah, and at Kibroth Hattavah: And when the Lord ſent them from Kadeſh-Barnea, ſaying, go up and poſſeſs the land which I have given you, then they rebelled, yea</hi> (ſays <hi>Moſes) you have been rebellious againſt the Lord from the day that I knew you.</hi> In the 33. of <hi>Numb.

How often in that time did they change their places, and yet ſtill the ſame? yea; it is ſaid <hi>Pſalm 106. 7. They provoked him at the Sea, even at the red Sea,</hi> there they ſinned againſt him, yea <hi>in the red Sea,</hi> not onely whiles they were on the bank, but even while they were paſſing through, the Lord by a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful miracle, having made it to them as dry land to walk upon; and one would have thought ſuch a place might have made ſome change in them, but it did not, there they ſtill continue their murmurings and their mutinings; and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43971:66"/>
thus ſome read it, <hi>they provoked him in the Sea,</hi> even when they ſaw that glorious work, and there lies the <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> that they provoked him even in that Sea which God carried them through.

And this hatred, if it be right, is univerſal, againſt all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as <hi>David hated every falſe way,</hi> hatred and enmity being againſt the whole kind, as a man hates the whole kind of Serpents and Toads, and ſo the Lamb of Wolves. 2 The neerer it is, the more we abhor it, it affecting more, as in our ſelves, and ours. 3.

And this is all the change and turn of many; they ſeem <hi>to return,</hi> but not to <hi>the moſt high,</hi> but take up in ſomething elſe, as in being meerly moral, or civil, or in ſome outward forms and ſuperſtitious ways of worſhip, or it may be they are not now prophane: but what are they? meer Scepticks in Religion and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up in diſputations about the ſame; they run roving here and there, ſometimes of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,<note place="margin">☞</note> and ſometimes of that, but never fix on God, nor Religion indeed. And truly this is too too much the guiſe of the turns of theſe times, but that turn which the Lord calls for, is, even unto him, <hi>Therefore alſo now, ſaith the Lord, turn ye even to me,</hi> and not to other things<note place="margin">Uſque ad me.</note> beſides me, or below me, or a this ſide me, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as far, and quite through unto me.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43971:74"/>
and this is the right turning indeed, when we give God the whole turn, and not the half one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo as to be half-converts, or almoſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but altogether ſo as to go through with the work, and not to ſet onely a little upon repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and turning, and then to give over; as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but never quite came into <hi>Canaan.</hi>

In true converſion there is not onely a converſion of the mind from errour, and hereſy, to aſſent to the true faith and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt; but alſo of the will, heart, and affections, to ſubmit to, and willingly obey the holy laws and commands of Chriſt. That's no true converſion, when men aſſent to the truth, and yet love the world, and their luſts ſtill, and are ungodly in their lives: but in true conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion there is a turning here alſo, and this is the main and chief, and all in all, and this is hard and rare; but the other, which is partial, is frequent, and often in Scripture condemned. <hi>Ezek. 33. 31. with their mouth</hi> (ſays God) <hi>they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi>

and <hi>Math. 15. 8. This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me,</hi> that's not turned, but in true converſion all is turned. Hence <hi>James 1. 26. If any man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>ſeems to be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</hi> For if he was truly religious, Religion would manifeſt it ſelf in and from his tongue alſo, though not onely, as well as be in his heart; that alſo would be turned from the evils thereof, as railing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling, fooliſh and idle and much ſpeaking, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring, which many that ſeem to be religious are very free in, and make no great matter of: but however ſuch may ſeem to others, or themſelves to be religious, by the practiſe of ſome outward duties, and by attending on God's worſhip, &amp;c.

Hence ſome have defin'd it, <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant turning of a man in his whole life, from all ſin, unto God, &amp;c.</hi> For as it is the work of the whole man, ſo of the whole life, and we are more and more to turn, none being ſo far turn'd from ſin to God, but have need ſtill to turn more. There is an initial, or firſt repentance, which is at our firſt calling, and bringing home to God; and then there is an after, or progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, which is the continuation, and going on forward in the firſt, throughout the whole courſe of our lives: and where this after does not ſucceed, the firſt was never, ſincere. Indeed at our firſt converſion we are turn'd to God, but by our continuing the ſame, we are turn'd more and more, till we return to that ſtate in which<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> we once were, and that is not till death; and therefore this turning is a continued act, and daily exerciſe all this life. And there is indeed matter enough to hold our repentance work all our lives, both in regard of the ſin of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, hearts, and lives, our daily infirmities, which as we daily renew, ſo are we to renew our repentance, and to perſevere and continue therein to the end, ſo as not to turn aſide again from God and his ways, <hi>to the crooked ways of ſin,</hi> nor <hi>from the holy commandement;</hi> for <hi>it had</hi>

If this be the onely way for a people to be ſaved, this then gives us to ſee, the true reaſon and ground, why the Lord is ſo exceeding ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and intent upon this, and does ſo often and earneſtly call and invite people to this, and preſs upon them this; that they would turn again unto him, and ſeek him, and his face and favour. Why, it is becauſe this is the very way, and the onely way for them to be ſaved; and is not there then good cauſe for it, that he ſhould be ſo earneſt, as the Scripture indeed every where declares him to be?

                  <hi>and his ſtrength, ſeek his face evermore, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo I might give you multitudes of places more, which let us ſee, how earneſt and intent the Lord is upon this, and it is becauſe this is the onely way for people to be ſaved, to be bleſſed and happy, and have it well with them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe elſe they periſh, and are ruined and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and it will certainly be ill with them for ever. And hence it is, that the Lord makes uſe of ſuch pathetical and affectionate expreſſions. <hi>Say unto them, as I live ſaith the Lord, I have</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will ye dye, O houſe of Iſrael.</hi> How vehemently does the Lord here expoſtulate and preſs this upon them? <hi>Turn ye, turn ye,</hi> which denotes the height and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of his affection and deſire, how much his heart was upon it, and is there not good reaſon for all this? why? they <hi>dye,</hi> and are undone, and periſh elſe, <hi>for why will ye dye?</hi> life and death are in theſe things, in turning or not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to God; as life is the happy effect of the one, ſo death and damnation is the fruit of the other. And is it any wonder the Lord is then ſo earneſt and importunate? when our <hi>weal</hi> or our <hi>woe,</hi> when it being <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill</hi> with us, when our happineſs or our miſery, our being ſaved or eternally deſtroyed, depends upon this. And hence the Lord is not content to ſpeak it once, but ſpeaks it again, calls for it twice, becauſe it was of ſuch abſolute and indiſpenſable neceſſity,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43971:99"/>
and not a ſmall matter, nor a buſineſs of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency. And what infinite cauſe have we then to bleſs the Lord, that he ſhould be ſo intent upon this, ſo frequently and earneſtly invite us to this, again and again, wherein our own good is ſo much concerned, and which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable neceſſity, that we cannot otherwiſe but periſh: and what can we indeed do better, or wherein can we be more happy than in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him?</p>
               <p n="6">6. This informs us, and gives us to ſee, whence it is that God's Prophets formerly, and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters alate, have been and ſtill are ſo frequent and earneſt in preaching and preſſing of this: why is it? becauſe ſo much depends on this, becauſe they know it cannot elſe be well with them, neither can they be ſaved, or be happy, nay they know it cannot elſe but be ill with them, and they muſt elſe periſh and be undone for ever, and therefore have they and do they ſtill ſo much urge and preſs this, not onely ſpeak but cry. <hi>Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom</hi>

In the laſt day, that great day of the feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, if any man thirſt, let him come unto me, and drink.</hi> O for poor ſinners to come to Chriſt to believe on him, and repent and turn to the Lord, is a matter of great conſequence, of infinite importance, not a thing of indifferency, but of abſolute neceſſity; and hence Jeſus Chriſt is ſo earneſt and intent upon this, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his poſture, <hi>he ſtood up,</hi> by his vehement ſpeaking, <hi>he cried,</hi> he ſpake with a lowd voice, which ſhewed the fervour and ardency of his Spirit.

Hence it was that that holy Martyr Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> when he came to the ſtake, cryed out ſo earneſtly and affectionately, <hi>O England, England, repent of thy ſins, repent of thy ſins,</hi> he knew it was the onely way of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> weal then, as it is now; and therefore

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:43971:120"/>
as in reference to ſo great a concern, not do what they might do: we are not able indeed to turn our ſelves; no, converſion is too great a work, and lies beyond our line, and we ſhould get a due ſenſe thereof, ſo as to drive us to God for help, but yet we may endeavour it, and attempt ſomething as in reference to it; ſomething we may do, but what (you will ſay) may we do? and what would you have us for to do? I ſhall ſhew you in ſeveral particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Attend conſtantly on the miniſtery of the Word,</hi> wait ſtill upon God in his ways, and in the uſe of thoſe means he hath inſtituted, appointed, and ſet apart to be inſtrumental as to that great work of turning you again to himſelf, and of bringing you into favour, and recovering again his face. Do as thoſe impotent folk, they could not indeed heal themſelves, yea, but they could and did lie <hi>at the Pool, waiting for the moving</hi>

                  <hi>of the waters,</hi> that they might be healed. Get there ſtill where Chriſt walks, and where he works, as <hi>Zacheus he got up into a tree,</hi> in the<note place="margin">Luke 19. 4.</note> way where Chriſt was to paſs, and who knows but Chriſt may look upon thee, as he did upon him, and it may be a time of love, and he may ſay to thee, <hi>though in thy bloud, live,</hi> and bring ſaving converſion, &amp; ſalvation home to thy ſoul. It is good being in God's ways, how many hath he ſavingly and graciouſly met there, and his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath been preſent <hi>to heal them,</hi> to <hi>convert and ſave them.</hi> The very work and buſineſs that he ſends his Miniſters about, it is (as he told <hi>Paul</hi> when he had converted him from a Perſecutor,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:43971:120"/>
to be a Preacher, and as you have heard) <hi>to open ſinners eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 26. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>light, and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> &amp;c. And how many thouſands of ſouls are there, who have experienc'd this, and for whom it hath been effected by their means, and why may it not be effected for thee alſo? The word is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a word of grace,</hi> a <hi>converting word,</hi> and wait on it for God to make it ſo to thy ſoul. <hi>Of his own will</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>begat he us by the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">James 1. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>word of truth,</hi> and why by the ſame word may he not beget thee, if thou attend upon it? God ſends his Miniſters to help people in this great work, <hi>And a Viſion appeared to Paul in the night,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 16. 9.</note> there ſtood a man of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and <hi>prayed him ſaying, come over into Macedonia and help us.</hi> Now be ſure then to be there where he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth ſuch help, which is the beſt help, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a thouſand times than the having ſuch come that might help you in other matters, as in your eſtates and in matters of the world, though it was to compaſs never ſo much of it. And how ſad muſt their condition then needs be, and how inexcuſable will they be found at that great day, who refuſe this help, who careleſly neglect or deſpiſe the Miniſtery appointed for ſo bleſſed an end, how deſervedly and inexcuſably will they periſh? and how by this act of theirs do they their own ſelves judg themſelves unworthy of converſion and ſalvation, as the Apoſtle told thoſe refractory Jews. <hi>Then Paul and Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>

                  <hi>waxed bold, and ſaid it was neceſſary that the word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken to you, but
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:43971:121"/>
ſeeing you put it from you, and judg your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life, lo we turn to the Gentiles.</hi> And therefore as ever you would be turned again unto God, wait for it, in a conſtant and diligent attending upon the plain and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful preaching of the word, which is the great organ and inſtrument which God hath inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that purpoſe; and how many bleſſed and glorious converſions have been effected by it, and that upon moſt indiſpoſed and unlikely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? and this is the great reaſon why Satan does ſo much rage, and ſet himſelf againſt it, it being the great Engine and Battery which God makes uſe of to deſtroy his Kingdom, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue poor ſouls out of his ſnares, and to turn them to himſelf: and this, when you go to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the word preach'd, you are chiefly to mind and look after, that it may have this bleſſed effect upon your ſouls, to turn you to God, and you ſhould be reſtleſs and unſatisfied till it be ſo. <hi>The Law of the Lord,</hi> that is, the<note place="margin">Pſalm 19. 7.</note> doctrine of the word, <hi>is perfect converting the ſoul.</hi> And O that it might convert mine, that it might have the ſame effectual work upon me, which it hath had upon others: and the rather you are to mind this, becauſe if you be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible by the word, neither would you <hi>be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded though one roſe from the dead. Luke 16. 30. And he ſaid, nay, father Abraham, but if one went unto them from the dead, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. v. 31. And he ſaid unto him, if they hear not Moſes, and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded, though one roſe from the dead.</hi> And
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:43971:121"/>
becauſe knowledg and underſtanding is initial and introductory, and primarily neceſſary as to converſion; for as God in the firſt Creation wrought light, ſo he does in converſion of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who by nature is a miſerable chaos of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; and ſeeing it is peoples ignorance and ſtupidity, and their want of knowledg of God, and themſelves of their malady and remedy, that does ſo hinder and indiſpoſe them as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, beg of God that the miniſtery of the word, which is called the key of knowledg, may be effectual to give thee knowledg and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and that thine eyes may <hi>be anointed with eye-ſalve, that thou mayeſt ſee.</hi> Do as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> adviſeth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. O how many are deſtroyed, and never converted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their ignorance and ſtupidity, becauſe the <hi>ſcales of ignorance are yet upon their eyes,</hi> and the <hi>vail upon their hearts!</hi> ignorance being not onely a great evil it ſelf, but a very ſource of all evils, and that which hinders all good; and therefore be earneſt for the removal of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When the Spirit at any time comes to thy ſoul,</hi> as he does to all at one time or other, and begins to ſtir and move thy heart, the Spirit it may be would convince thee of ſin, and humble thy ſoul, and bring thee to ſorrow for ſin here, to prevent worſe, even eternal horrours hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For do any think ever to go to heaven, and never to have their hearts toucht for their ſins? It is as impoſſible, as for a man below to reach the heavens with his hands. Now when I ſay the Spirit begins to do this, this is thy ſeaſon,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:43971:122"/>
prize it and improve it, <hi>take the preſent opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and beſeech him whatever he does to go on. O cheriſh and make much of ſuch motions, for they are very precious! and do not quench them, nor reſiſt the Spirit, but give up thy ſelf to be wrought upon by him; do not ſay, Go away, &amp; come again another time. Remember, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is the worker of repentance, is not at thy beck, neither canſt thou ſet him a work when thou pleaſeſt, and therefore let him work when he pleaſes, and remember God hath ſaid, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man,</hi> and<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 3.

                  </note> way to live, to attain to that repentance which is unto life, and to <hi>go in the way of underſtanding,</hi> which is to depart from evil. I dare be bold to ſay, and affirm, that there is no one thing under heaven that is a greater hinderance or obſtacle to the work of ſaving converſion, and bringing a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner home unto God, than looſe, jovial, vain, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed company: for theſe take off the ſinner from being ever ſerious and conſiderate of his preſent condition, and from weighing his ſins, and the evil of his ways, and more and more hardens him therein, and ſo proves a marvelous impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43971:122"/>
as to any ſuch work. How often in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and under a Sermon, does the heart of a ſinner ſeem to be wrought upon, and he is under ſome conviction of the evil of his former ways, and courſes, and reſolves to amend, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by falling into vain and evil company, all dwindles away and withers, and comes to nothing; and <hi>as a dog returns to his vomit, ſo a fool returneth to his folly.</hi> Thus how many have been affected, and almoſt perſwaded to be converts at a Sermon one day, &amp; by falling into evil company have been the ſame again the next day. And therefore, hence it was, that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> when he perceived that the Jews he had been preaching unto, were affected with what he had delivered, and their hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be wrought upon, and to be toucht for their ſin, they asking him and the reſt of the Apoſtles, what they ſhould do? he anſwers firſt to them in general, <hi>Repent;</hi> but then afterward, that ſo good a work might not be hindered, nor obſtructed, he gives them withall that ſpecial advice, <hi>Save your ſelves from this untoward ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 2. 40.</note> as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, I perceive God has begun indeed to touch your hearts for your ſins, and my advice to you is, to repent and turn to the Lord; but now that you be not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered therein, this <hi>I teſtifie and exhort too,</hi> that you aſſociate no longer as you have done with this untoward generation, but ſave your ſelves from it, elſe they will flatten and deaden that work again, and ſo hinder the converſion and ſalvation of your ſouls: and though other words,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:43971:123"/>
with which the Apoſtle did teſtifie and exhort, might be left out; yet this, as that which was of ſo great concern, the holy Ghoſt would have recorded: <hi>And with many other words did he teſtifie and exhort, ſaying, ſave your ſelves from this untoward generation:</hi> And ſo do you, quit <hi>Egypt,</hi> if ever you would come to <hi>Canaan;</hi> and the Devil's diſciples, if ever you would become Chriſt's: bid them depart from you now, that Chriſt do not bid you for ever depart from him, avoid them as you would a Peſt-houſe, or thoſe that have the plague, as being more dangerous and pernicious. Who can touch Pitch, and not be defiled therewith? or lie on a dunghill, and not ſmell of it? Examples are more prevalent than precepts, and ſoon make impreſſion. Hence, <hi>I have not ſat,</hi> ſays <hi>David, with vain perſons,</hi>

ſhall ſtill deſpiſe the grace and mercy of God inviting you to repent, you will be ſure to find, and feel too, his power in puniſhing you, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to repent. Thus though you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert your ſelves, nor of your ſelves turn again to God, yet there are ſeveral things you ſee, which you may, yea and ought, for to do, as in reference to this turn, and which if you do not do, you will be found wholly without excuſe, and ſelf-deſtroyers, and your bloud will be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your own heads, becauſe you did not do what you might. For you muſt not think God ſhould do all, and you do nothing; hence in Scripture converſion is ſpoken of, not onely as<note place="margin">Acts 11. 18. 2 Tim. 2. 25. &amp;c.</note> God's work, as moſt truly and properly it is, but in ſome ſenſe as man's, he really indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, and making uſe of all ways and means<note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 18. Zach, 1. 3. &amp;c.</note> preſcribed to further it; not that we can turn our ſelves, but that we to our utmoſt uſe the beſt means, and take the moſt effectual courſe, for to do, that in ſome ſenſe we may be ſaid to do. And thus, though the work of converſion be properly God's work, yet, as one well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, it is ſometimes aſcribed to our ſelves, that we ſhould not be negligent; ſometimes to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and inſtruments, to ſhew we muſt not contemn their help; and ſometimes to God, that we may not be ſelf-confident, or unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And the great reaſon indeed why ſinners do not repent, nor turn from their ſins to God, is not becauſe they cannot (though they cannot) but becauſe they will not: for they think they can, and yet will not, nay they will not try whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:43971:137"/>
they can or no, nor uſe the power which God hath given them; they can do more than they do, but will not do it, they are ſlothful and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and will not ſet themſelves to uſe all the means they might; and beſides, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their Cannots, and therefore they may thank themſelves that they periſh, and do not repent nor turn to God. But for farther ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as to this great point, I ſhall refer the Reader to that <hi>excellent Tract of Mr. William Fenner,</hi> called, <hi>Wilful impenitency the greateſt ſelf-murder,</hi> and ſhall here anſwer an objection that may ariſe in our way, <hi>viz.</hi> this, that if we cannot convert our ſelves, nor turn again to the Lord, why are we then ſo often called upon, and exhorted to this, as if it was in our power? To this I anſwer: 1. It is true indeed, we cannot turn our ſelves, no, we may as ſoon create a world as do it, the work of Converſion is a greater work than the work of Creation, and man that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as make one hair of his head black or white, nor adde one cubit to his ſtature, nor do the leſs, how ſhould he do the greater? And therefore for any to interpret thoſe Texts, that call upon man to turn to God, as if it was in man's power to convert himſelf, as the Papiſts, <hi>Arminians,</hi> and ſome others do, it is to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpret and pervert the true ſenſe and meaning of them. But 2. though we cannot convert our ſelves, yet that we are ſo often exhorted, and called upon to do that which is not in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do, <hi>viz.</hi> to turn to God, it is not in vain.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Though we cannot convert our ſelves, yet theſe exhortations, calls, and commands, are not in vain, for <hi>God many times works in them, and by them, and makes them effectual as to the work,</hi> as to turn ſinners again; they are ways and inſtruments, in and by which the Spirit put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth his power, and comes into the heart. As when God at firſt ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, there was light,</hi> and when Chriſt ſaid to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus, come forth, he came forth;</hi> thus God many times by his Spirit, and grace, and the ſecret virtue and power thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is pleaſed ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to operate in and by thoſe means, as to make them effectual as to that great work: ſo that while a man ſpeaks to the ear, he many times ſpeaks to the heart, and does ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany what is ſpoken, with his own power, as to make it the power of God to converſion and ſalvation; as while <hi>Peter ſpake, the holy Ghoſt</hi>

                  <hi>remains a reſt for the people of God,</hi> ſo a time of cooling and refreſhing; and who would not long for it, in ſuch a dry ſcorching place, and weary land, as this world is? It is a figurative ſpeech, and a fit Metaphor, eſpecially as to the condition of thoſe Regions which were ſo exceeding hot, and where workmen being even ſpent with heat, did retire into the cool ſhades for refreſhing; and this refreſhing comes from <hi>the preſence of the Lord,</hi> that is, from his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial gracious preſence, or from his face, that is, the ſhines of his face, the bright beams of his favour, the light of his countenance, and whence

But how is it ſaid, that your ſins may be blotted out then? are they not blotted out before? yes, the meaning thereof is, that then ye may find, and feel, and experience the comfort of their being blotted out; and while others ſins ſtand ſtill upon record, and therefore to be accounted for, the red lines of Chriſt's bloud may then (as it were) be ſeen drawn over yours, the comfort of which at that day will be more than the poſſeſſion of many worlds; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it will be the heat of the day to others, who yet perſiſt and go on in their ſins, this will make it the cool of the day to all ſuch, and as the moſt refreſhing ſhadow after heat, yea much more refreſhing.

               <p>AND let us not onely incourage one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to turn to God, but be ſure our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion be <hi>ſincere.</hi> 1. Let there be a <hi>ſound convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin,</hi> and a kindly <hi>compunction</hi> for it, with a thorow <hi>averſion from it</hi> to the Lord, both in <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> in inward <hi>principles</hi> and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>practiſes,</hi> there being a change both of the diſpoſition, and affection, and love to ſin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and of the converſation without, and theſe depend one upon another. For 'till the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be throughly <hi>convinct of ſin,</hi> how ſhould the heart be kindly <hi>contrite for ſin?</hi> and 'till the heart be contrite for ſin, how ſhould it forſake or <hi>turn</hi> from ſin? and 'till it do turn from <hi>ſin,</hi> how ſhould it turn to <hi>God?</hi> And 2. let this turn be ſuch as <hi>is of God,</hi> as alſo <hi>unto God,</hi> quite<note place="margin">Jer. 4. 1.</note> through unto him, and not to any thing below him, or on this ſide him. O how ſad is it to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſhipwrack neer the haven, to turn towards God, and yet never to reach nor take up in God, as our true and proper center! to come up out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and yet never to come into <hi>Canaan!</hi> not to be <hi>far from the Kingdom of God,</hi> from heaven, and yet to fall ſhort of it, and to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into <hi>hell!</hi> 3. Let it be ſuch as <hi>ariſes from

faith.</hi> 4. Let it be <hi>hearty,</hi> with <hi>all</hi> or the <hi>whole heart;</hi> no part of the heart here being reſerved for ſin, but the whole heart inclin'd one way, and that to God: as it is ſaid of good King <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King. 23. 25.</note> that like unto him <hi>there was no King before him, that turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his ſoul, and with all his might, &amp;c.</hi> Indeed the heart is the main, and what is done<note place="margin">Quod cor non facit, non fit.</note> here, unleſs it be with the heart, it is not done. And in what ſhould we be hearty indeed, if not in what we do to God, and in what tends ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely to our own good? 5. Let it be <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.</hi> 1. As to the <hi>ſubject turning, the whole</hi> man, body and ſoul, and all the faculties of the one, and members of the other, compleat as to <hi>parts,</hi> though not <hi>degrees,</hi> as to <hi>extenſion</hi> though not <hi>perfection;</hi> in every <hi>part,</hi> though but <hi>in part.</hi> As the Air in the dawning, is light in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every part, though but in part; elſe if any <hi>one part</hi> be unturn'd, we ſhall (as one expreſſes it) with our whole <hi>go to hell,</hi> and therefore as all of us, and in us, is turn'd away from God, never let us reſt till all be turn'd again to God. 2. As to the <hi>object, turn'd from,</hi> and <hi>turn'd to,</hi> from all <hi>ſin</hi> to all that is <hi>holy</hi> and righteous, from every falſe and crooked way to every true and right way; for as there's no Brook ſo ſmall, no River<note place="margin">Pſ. 119. 101, 128.</note> ſo little, but if a man follow it, it will bring him to the Sea, ſo there's no ſin ſo ſmall, but if a man<note place="margin">Optima poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia eſt nova vita. <hi>Luther.</hi> Poenitere â malis, &amp; abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere à malis.</note> addict himſelf unto it, and ſtill follow and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it to the end, it will certainly bring him to the <hi>dead ſalt Sea of eternal horrours,</hi> and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting torments.

And indeed the very eſſence of repentance lies in this, <hi>in our turning with our whole man from all ſin, with grief and hatred of it,</hi> unto God, and all that is good; but while we condemn ſin with our tongues, if yet we regard and take pleaſure in any ſin in our hearts, we are far yet from God, yea abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him. 6. <hi>Let our turning to God be from right principles,</hi> and upon right grounds, ſpiritual grounds, as <hi>in the name of Chriſt,</hi> in his<note place="margin">Col. 3. 17.</note> ſtrength, and as looking for acceptance both of our perſons, and repentance, in and through him, and his merits, mediation, and ſatisfaction. So let it be <hi>in conſcience of his commands,</hi> and <hi>out of love to God,</hi> becauſe we love God, therefore let us fear any longer to diſpleaſe him, and turn to him, that we may no longer offend nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him.

               <p>AND let us now, by ſuch a turning as this, but <hi>prove God,</hi> and ſee if he will not bleſs us, and do us good. There is indeed an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<note place="margin">Deut. 6. 16.</note> proving of God, which is call'd a <hi>tempting</hi> of him, and forbidden; but this, of proving God, in doing our duty, and in returning to him, he puts his people upon. <hi>Bring you</hi> (ſays he) <hi>all</hi>

And what wonderful condeſcenſion is here, that the great God, even the <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi>

The Lord appeals to <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> as concerning the experience his good father <hi>Joſiah,</hi> upon tryal, had had of his goodneſs and bounty upon his obedience of his commands, cauſing it to be well with him, when he did well: <hi>Shalt thou reign</hi> (ſays God) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>

                  <hi>The word of the Lord is tried,</hi> it is upon good<note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 30.—12. 6.</note> proof found to be moſt true, without the leaſt droſs of deceit. And thus Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid to be a <hi>tried ſtone, i. e.</hi> upon tryal found moſt firm, and precious, fit and fully ſufficient to bear up all that build upon him; and thus he is a <hi>ſtone of proof,</hi> as we ſay <hi>armour of proof, i. e.</hi> a ſtone throughly <hi>prov'd,</hi> that will certainly ſtay by, and ſtay up, all that by faith reſt and rely upon him, amidſt whatever ſtorms may make head againſt them, and that while others fickle ſtays and refuges of lies, which they fondly relied on, are ſwept away. And thus God as to his goodneſs and faithfulneſs, which he manifeſts to ſuch as truly turn to him, is a well tried and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd God, and ſo will ever be, as hath been heard, ſo ſhall it be ſeen, and as it hath been told, ſo ſhall it be found, and much more.

So that the Soul that has it, has all good, all mercies, in the fountain, and root, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of them; it has that which produces and procures all good, and remedies all evils.

And truly, next to the converſion and ſalvation of our own ſouls, we cannot buſie our ſelves to better purpoſe, not onely as to their, and our own comfort and benefit, but the good of the whole; ſo that this is every ones concern: for as <hi>one ſinner,</hi> ſtill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Eccl. 9. 18.</note> on in his ſins, may much hinder, ſo one ſinner being turn'd again may much further the<note place="margin">Gen. 13. 32.</note> good of the whole. And who knows, whether one or a few ſinners more being turn'd again, may not help to make up that number, which being found, God may be pleas'd for their ſakes to ſpare the whole?
